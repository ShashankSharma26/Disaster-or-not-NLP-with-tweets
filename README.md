# Disaster or not? NLP with tweets

The ubiquitousness of mobile phones enables people to share everything on the go through platforms like Twitter. Amongst all other purposes of tweets, it is also used to share an emergency/disaster. 

Let's assume the following tweets: 

"Never let the fire die inside of you"

"The forest fire continues to haunt the country"

While both these tweets uses the word "fire", the context is totally different. This NLP project aims to predict whether a tweet describes a real disaster or not.
