The following inferences are drawn from above:

* Keywords which are least related to disaster tweets are related to a considerable large number of non-disaster tweets.
* Keywords which are least related to non-disaster tweets are related to a considerable large number of disaster tweets.
* Keywords which are most related to non-disaster tweets DO NOT necessarily have low number of disaster tweets.
* Keywords which are most related to disaster tweets DO NOT necessarily have low number of non-disaster tweets.
* Certain words that imply a disaster in common usage such as explode,electrocute etc are keywords to more non-disaster tweets.
